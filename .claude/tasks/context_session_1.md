# Context Session 1 - Loja de Pá AWS Services

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js project for "Loja de Pá", a Brazilian AWS consulting company. The project showcases AWS services and consulting offerings.

## Current Structure
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- Shadcn/ui components

## Services Identified
From the services.tsx file, I found 6 AWS services that need individual pages:

1. **Migração para AWS** - AWS Migration
2. **Arquitetura Serverless** - Serverless Architecture  
3. **Segurança AWS** - AWS Security
4. **Otimização de Custos** - Cost Optimization
5. **DevOps & CI/CD** - DevOps & CI/CD
6. **Bancos de Dados** - Databases

## Current Task
Create individual pages for each service with "Saiba mais" (Learn More) functionality. Each service card has a "Saiba mais" button that should link to dedicated service pages.

## Services Details
Each service has:
- Icon (Lucide React)

2. ✅ Updated the "Saiba mais" buttons to link to respective service pages
3. ✅ Created dynamic routing for service pages
4. ✅ Added proper SEO metadata for each service page
5. ✅ Optimized all content following SEO copywriting guidelines

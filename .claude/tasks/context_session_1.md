# Context Session 1 - Loja de Pá AWS Services

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js project for "Loja de Pá", a Brazilian AWS consulting company. The project showcases AWS services and consulting offerings.

## Current Structure
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- Shadcn/ui components

## Services Identified
From the services.tsx file, I found 6 AWS services that need individual pages:

1. **Migração para AWS** - AWS Migration
2. **Arquitetura Serverless** - Serverless Architecture  
3. **Segurança AWS** - AWS Security
4. **Otimização de Custos** - Cost Optimization
5. **DevOps & CI/CD** - DevOps & CI/CD
6. **Bancos de Dados** - Databases

## Current Task
Create individual pages for each service with "Saiba mais" (Learn More) functionality. Each service card has a "Saiba mais" button that should link to dedicated service pages.

## Services Details
Each service has:
- Icon (Lucide React)
- Title
- Description
- Features array
- Badge (category)

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created individual service pages in app/services/[slug] directory
2. ✅ Updated the "Saiba mais" buttons to link to respective service pages
3. ✅ Created dynamic routing for service pages
4. ✅ Added proper SEO metadata for each service page
5. ✅ Optimized all content following SEO copywriting guidelines

## Service Pages Created
Each service now has a dedicated page with:
- SEO-optimized titles and meta descriptions
- Detailed content following E-E-A-T principles
- FAQ sections (5 questions each)
- Benefits with cited sources
- Step-by-step process explanations
- Proper internal linking structure

## SEO Optimization Applied
- Primary keywords and related keywords for each service
- Meta titles under 60 characters
- Meta descriptions between 120-160 characters
- FAQ sections optimized for featured snippets
- Internal linking structure
- Source citations for all claims
- Conversational tone with authority
- Scannable content with proper headings

## Services Available
1. **Migração para AWS** - /services/migracao-aws
2. **Arquitetura Serverless** - /services/arquitetura-serverless
3. **Segurança AWS** - /services/seguranca-aws
4. **Otimização de Custos** - /services/otimizacao-custos
5. **DevOps & CI/CD** - /services/devops-cicd
6. **Bancos de Dados** - /services/bancos-dados

## Architecture Improvements Applied
Following Next.js best practices, we've implemented:

### ✅ Data Layer Separation
- **Created `lib/services-data.ts`**: Centralized data management with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Server-side Data Fetching**: Async functions with caching strategies ready for external APIs
- **Type Safety**: Proper `LucideIcon` typing for icons, eliminating `any` types

### ✅ Component Architecture
- **Server Components**: Main service pages remain Server Components for optimal performance
- **Client Components**: Interactive elements (CTA buttons) properly separated
- **Data Fetching**: Server-side data fetching with `async/await` in Server Components
- **Static Generation**: All service pages pre-rendered at build time

### ✅ Caching Strategy
- **Ready for External APIs**: Data layer prepared for CMS/database integration
- **Caching Examples**: Commented examples showing `next: { revalidate: 3600 }` patterns
- **Static Generation**: All pages pre-rendered for maximum performance

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced from 497B to 482B per service page
- **Code Splitting**: Proper separation of concerns
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused imports removed

## Mobile Responsiveness Improvements (Latest Update)
Fixed mobile responsiveness issues across all service pages:

### ✅ Hero Section
- Responsive text sizing: text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl
- Improved spacing: py-12 sm:py-16 lg:py-20

- Better line height and text spacing

## CTA Buttons Fix (Latest Update)
Fixed the "Agendar Consulta Gratuita" (Schedule Free Consultation) buttons that were not working correctly:

### ✅ Problem Identified
- CTA buttons in service pages were trying to scroll to element with ID `contato` that only exists on the home page
- This caused the buttons to not function when clicked from individual service pages

### ✅ Solution Implemented
- Updated `components/ui/cta-buttons.tsx` with smart navigation logic
- Added `useRouter` hook from Next.js for programmatic navigation
- Implemented conditional behavior:
  - **Home page**: Scrolls smoothly to contact section (`#contato`)
  - **Service pages**: Navigates to home page with contact hash (`/#contato`)

### ✅ Testing Results
- ✅ Home page: Button scrolls to contact section
- ✅ Service pages: Button redirects to home page and scrolls to contact section
- ✅ All CTA buttons now work consistently across all pages
- ✅ User experience improved with proper navigation flow

### ✅ Code Changes
```typescript
const handleScheduleConsultation = () => {
  // Check if we're on the home page
  if (window.location.pathname === '/') {
    // If on home page, scroll to contact section
    document.getElementById('contato')?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })
  } else {
    // If on service page, navigate to home page and then scroll to contact
    router.push('/#contato')
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor SEO performance
- Consider adding more internal links
- Add structured data markup if needed
- Implement external data source (CMS/database) when needed
- Test mobile responsiveness across different devices
